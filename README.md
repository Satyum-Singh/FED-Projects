# FED-Projects

Welcome to our Git repository for the 5th semester web development projects! This repository is intended to be used by students to collaborate on building exciting web development projects using various technologies, including __HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS,__ and the __MERN__ stack. Below, you'll find essential information and guidelines to help you get started.


## Tech Stack 

1. __HTML__ : HyperText Markup Language is the foundation of any web page. It provides the structure and content for your projects.

1. __CSS__ : Cascading Style Sheets allow you to style and design your web pages, making them visually appealing and interactive.

1. __JavaScript__ : As a powerful scripting language, JavaScript enables you to add dynamic and interactive elements to your web pages.

1. __ReactJS__ : A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, ReactJS makes it easier to create reusable UI components and manage application state efficiently.

1. __MERN Stack__ : The MERN stack comprises four technologies - MongoDB (database), ExpressJS (back-end framework), ReactJS (front-end library), and Node.js (server-side runtime). It's a powerful combination for building full-stack web applications.


## Getting Started
> To get started with contributing to the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local development environment.
1. Create a new branch for each project you'll be working on.
1. Set up the required development environment, including Node.js and other dependencies, as needed.
1. Choose a project from the list of proposed ideas or suggest a new one.
1. Start coding and commit your changes regularly.
1. Push your changes to your feature branch and create a pull request when you're ready for code review.



## Guidelines

+ __Branching__ : Each project should have its own branch. When starting a new project, create a new branch from the __'main'__ branch and give it a descriptive name.

+ __Code Review__ : Before merging any branch into __'main'__, ensure that your code has been reviewed by at least one other team member. Code reviews help maintain code quality and catch potential bugs.

+ __Commit Messages__ : Write clear and concise commit messages. A good commit message explains the changes made in the commit and follows a standard format.

+ __Project Structure__ : Organize your project directories and files properly. Follow a consistent structure, especially when using the MERN stack.

+ __Documentation__ : Document your code and project setup for better collaboration and future reference.

+ __Issues and Projects__ : Use GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests. Utilize the Projects feature to manage project milestones and workflows effectively.

+ __Code Style__ : Agree upon a coding style guide (e.g., _ _indentation, naming conventions_ _) and stick to it across all projects. It enhances readability and maintainability.

+ __Testing__ : Whenever applicable, write unit tests for your code. This helps in identifying issues early and ensures the stability of the project.

+ __Respectful Communication__ : Interact with your team members respectfully and constructively. Encourage open discussions and feedback.

+ __Security__ : Be cautious about storing sensitive information in the repository. Avoid committing credentials or API keys. Utilize environment variables for sensitive data.


## Code Review

All pull requests will undergo a code review process. Reviewers will provide feedback, and once the code is approved, it will be merged into the main project branch.



## Collaboration

Collaboration is the key to success in any project. Work together, share knowledge, and support each other throughout the semester. If you encounter any issues or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your team members or use the repository's issue tracker.

Let's make this semester a productive and enjoyable learning experience! Happy coding! ðŸš€


## Resources
> Here are some helpful resources to improve your skills with the tech stacks we'll be using:

+ __[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)__ : A comprehensive resource for web development technologies.
+ __[React Documentation](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)__ : Official documentation for React JS.
+ __[MERN Stack Tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mern-stack-tutorial)__ : A guide to getting started with the MERN stack.
  
 Let's create amazing web development projects together and make the most of our 5th semester! Good Luck :+1: and Happy coding! ðŸš€
